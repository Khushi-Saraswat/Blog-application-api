# üöÄ Blog Application - Spring Boot Project

This Blog Application is a robust backend system built using **Spring Boot**, tailored for managing blog posts, categories, and user interactions. It integrates several advanced features including NLP-based comment moderation, content scheduling, SEO-friendly slugs, PDF exporting, and estimated read-time‚Äîall making it an ideal showcase for Java backend development.

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

> üõ† **In Progress**

- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** (Planned):  
  Secure authentication using token-based sessions for stateless REST APIs. Each login returns a signed token, which is required to access protected endpoints.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** (Planned):  
  Fine-grained access will be managed based on user roles like `ADMIN`, `AUTHOR`, and `READER`. Specific permissions will be applied on routes like post creation, comment approval, etc.

---

## üö¶ Core Features

### üìù Post Management
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, edit, delete, and fetch blog posts.
- **Slug URLs**: Every post and category has a **slug** field (e.g., `my-first-post`), which is used to generate SEO-friendly and human-readable URLs.
- **PDF Export**: Posts can be exported as PDF documents using libraries like **Apache PDFBox** or **iText**.
- **Read Time Estimation**: Automatically estimates the reading time of a post based on word count (average reading speed: 200 words/min).

---

### ‚è∞ Scheduled Publishing

> ‚úÖ **Implemented using Spring Scheduler**

- You can schedule a post to be **published at a future date/time** using a timestamp.
- This is achieved using Spring‚Äôs `@Scheduled` and a background task that checks draft posts for their scheduled publish time.
- A cron job or fixed delay periodically runs in the background, and when the current time matches the scheduled time, the post's status changes from `DRAFT` to `PUBLISHED`.

---

### üìö Category Management

- **Slug Generation**: Generates slug from the category name (e.g., "Java Basics" ‚Üí `java-basics`) for clean URLs.
- **Soft Delete**: Instead of deleting categories from the DB, a flag (`deleted = true`) is used. This allows admins to **restore** them if needed.

---

### üí¨ Comment System

- **Like/Dislike**: Users can express their opinion on each comment.
  
### üß† Comment Moderation with Stanford NLP

> ‚úÖ **Implemented using Stanford CoreNLP**

- Every comment submitted is passed through **Stanford NLP**'s sentiment and toxicity analysis.
- If inappropriate or toxic content is detected:
  - The comment is flagged as **"Pending Approval"**.
  - Only users with **admin role** can review and approve/reject such comments.
- Stanford NLP helps maintain a safe and respectful environment on the platform.
